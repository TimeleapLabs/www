title { Run Your Own Timeleap Node in One Command }

Timeleap is now easier than ever to install and run. We've rebuilt the onboarding flow, added a unified CLI, switched entirely to Docker, and bootstrapped the plugin system. All of it built with the community in mind.

list {
  items = One-line install script for macOS and Linux,
  items = Unified CLI to manage nodes, secrets, and plugins,
  items = Rootless Docker runtime with a 12MB footprint,
  items = Plugin registry and community subnet live,
  items = Full web UI coming soon
}

code {
  language = bash,
  content = """
    curl -fsSL https://timeleap.swiss/install | bash
  """
}

You no longer need to manually edit multiple files.  
Everything is handled through inlineCode { tlp }, the new CLI that manages your nodes, secrets, and plugins from one place.

title { 🐳 Full Docker Support, size = 2 }

Timeleap now runs fully in Docker, with a minimal 12MB footprint.  
Everything is isolated, rootless, and just works out of the box.

This change makes it dead simple to join the network. Just install and run. We take care of the rest.

And if you’re not living in the terminal like some of us, that’s fine. A full web UI is on the way to help you manage your nodes and plugins without writing a single command.

title { 🔌 Plugin Registry, size = 2 }

Plugins currently live in a shared repository.  
A dedicated platform is coming, with install and search support directly from the inlineCode { tlp } CLI and browser.

For now, you can share and contribute through the link { to = "https://github.com/TimeleapLabs/plugins", Github repo }

title { 🙏 Thanks to the Community, size = 2 }

The new onboarding flow was shaped directly by feedback and contributions from community members.  
We’re building this with you. And because of you.

Hamed is officially stepping into the DevRel role at Timeleap.  
He’ll be building real use cases, sharing his learning process publicly, and helping community members turn their ideas into working nodes and plugins.  
He’s also in charge of our new community subnet.

If you want to test the network, deploy plugins, or run a worker, you’ll be able to join his subnet and start building right away.

Templates will be available through the inlineCode { tlp } CLI in the next few days.  
Hamed will walk you through it soon with examples you can run in his subnet.

Install the CLI.  
Get your nodes ready.  
Embark on Hamed’s journey to ship workloads on the network.
