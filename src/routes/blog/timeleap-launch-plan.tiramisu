title { Timeleap Launch Plan }

We announced in our previous blog post that we are ready with our v1.0.0 release
candidate and are now preparing for the mainnet release. In this post, we'll go
over the launch plan for Timeleap and what you can expect in the coming year.

title { Timeleap: Generic Purpose Compute Engine, size = 2 }

Timeleap is a generic-purpose compute engine that can be used to run code on any
device, anywhere. While you can use Timeleap practically for any compute
purpose, going to market with such a broad offering is challenging. We have
decided to focus on a few key use cases to start with and expand from there.

As you can see from our new website design, we are focusing primarily on Industry
4.0 and IoT. Timeleap is the perfect solution for offloading compute tasks from
IoT devices to the cloud and for running machine learning models on the edge.
The built-in support for message queues and WebSockets makes it easy to connect
Timeleap to existing infrastructure, helping devices communicate with each other
and the cloud.

Even with Industry 4.0 and IoT as our main focus, we are not forgetting our
existing users. As we announced on our social media channels, we've been doing
extensive R&D to link Industry 4.0 and IoT with our existing user base. We are
thrilled to announce that we have a few surprises in store for our existing
users, and we can't wait to share them with you.

Let us begin with a small proof of concept we have been working on before diving
into the launch plan.

title { Timeleap AI Camera, size = 2 }

We've created a small proof of concept that bridges industrial use cases and our
existing user base. This project showcases what you can achieve with Timeleap: a
smart camera capable of detecting objects in photos or running any AI model on
them. Measuring 5.9 by 3.75 centimeters, it demonstrates how Timeleap can
offload heavy computation even on a tiny device.

We intentionally made the camera small to show that you can run Timeleap on any
device, no matter how small. The camera is also a great example we can physically
show at events, and a great promotional item for our partners, users, and
investors. We are planning to give away a few of these cameras to our partners
and users, so stay tuned for more information on that.

Our target audience for the Timeleap AI Camera includes developers and hobbyists
who are interested in AI and IoT and want to experiment with Timeleap. We plan
to release the camera as an open-source project, allowing you to build your own
camera and run your own AI models on it. You can already find the source
code for the link { camera firmware, to =
https://github.com/TimeleapLabs/ai_camera_firmware } on our GitHub repository.

You can see the camera in action in the picture above, running an image caption
AI model on the photos taken by the camera. The camera is connected to the
Timeleap network.

title { "GameFi, AI, and Distributed Compute", size = 2 }

Initially, we were planning to focus only on Industry 4.0 and IoT, postponing
our plans for the Timeleap OS and the Timeleap App Store. However, after
hours of internal discussions, we've decided to move forward with our original
plan and expand our offering to GameFi, AI, and distributed applications.

We are releasing a handheld console that runs Timeleap OS, tailored for
distributed compute and crypto-gaming. The console will include an integrated
hardware wallet to keep your assets safe. All the underlying infrastructure for
the console will run on the Timeleap network, whether it's for notifications,
multiplayer gaming, computation offloading, or running AI models.

We'll focus on GameFi first, as we believe the gaming industry is ready for a
change. We plan to release a few exclusive games that showcase the power of
Timeleap, and we are working with several partners to bring their games to the
Timeleap network. The device will include everything you need to play these
games and will be available for pre-purchase on our website.

We've been conducting research over the past few weeks to find the best hardware
for the console, which we'll cover in a future blog post. Even though the device
will be Timeleap-first and optimized for Timeleap, we are not planning to lock
it down to the Timeleap network. The device won't be vendor-locked, and you can
run your own software on it or even install your own OS. Compatibility with
existing software and hardware is important to us, and we are working hard to
make the device as compatible as possible.

the Timeleap handheld console, running the Fishing Planet" }

There will be a docking mode with support for external GPUs. More details about
the console will be shared in the coming weeks, so stay tuned.

With the above devices and projects in mind, we plan to launch Timeleap on the
mainnet alongside the official release of the Timeleap handheld console. This
way, there will already be proper use cases for the Timeleap network, allowing
us to showcase the power of Timeleap to the world.

The GameFi industry is growing rapidly, and we believe that the Timeleap network
is the perfect solution for the industry. This project gives us plenty of
opportunities for collaboration with other companies and allows us to onboard
new users to the Timeleap network. It also helps us italic { show } continuous
updates to our existing users and engage the community. We await your feedback
every step of the way, and we are excited to see what you will build with
Timeleap.
