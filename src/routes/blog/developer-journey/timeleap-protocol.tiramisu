title { Timeleap: The Communication Protocol }

Distributed computation has always been stuck with a tradeoff: fast or secure,
but never both. The Timeleap Protocol changes that. The Timeleap protocol was
designed and refined around two core goals: bold { speed } and bold { security
}. Timeleap enables nodes on a distributed network to share data and state with
each other in a scalable and efficient manner. Often, this data is sensitive and
requires security without sacrificing performance.
