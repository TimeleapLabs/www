title { Timeleap: The Communication Protocol }

Distributed computation has always been stuck with a tradeoff: fast or secure,
but never both. The Timeleap Protocol changes that. The Timeleap protocol was
designed and refined around two core goals: bold { speed } and bold { security
}. Timeleap enables nodes on a distributed network to share data and state with
each other in a scalable and efficient manner. Often, this data is sensitive and
requires security without sacrificing performance.

Picture this: a network of wearable health devices needs to process real-time
heart rate and motion data for an AI-driven fitness coach. Each device alone is
too limited to run the model. With Timeleap, these devices can offload parts of
the computation to multiple nearby nodes on a secure network. The nodes work
together to process the data quickly, sending the results back to the devices in
seconds, while maintaining the privacy of sensitive health information.
