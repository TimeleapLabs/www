title { Watermark Plugin }

My goal as the new DevRel engineer is to learn and build in public, creating
useful examples along the way. That's why my next project is to build an image
watermarking plugin.

This project is a perfect choice for a few reasons:

list {
    items = bold { Working with Files }: 
    I want to learn how to handle different data types specifically image files
    in Sia.,
    items = bold { A Useful Function }:
    Watermarking is a genuinely useful function that anyone from small
    businesses to individual creators can use. A good real use case example for
    a plugin.,
    items = "This plugin perfectly demonstrates the purpose of Timeleap's
    distributed network. You can create a powerful plugin, add it to a subnet,
    and set a fee for its usage. Other developers can then tap into the
    network's computation power to use your function for their own needs,
    turning your code into a monetized application."
}

In this article, I'll take you through my journey of building this plugin, from
my initial learning to the final implementation.
