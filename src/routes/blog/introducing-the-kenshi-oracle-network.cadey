[heading Introducing the Kenshi Oracle Network]

The Kenshi Oracle Network is a complete platform for building custom oracles. It takes care
of the boring and time consuming stuff like event sourcing, task queues, security, caching,
scaling, nonce management, error management, data delivery, and retries so you can focus on
your business logic. With the
Kenshi [link /docs/services/oracle-network/custom Oracle Network],
you develop your oracle's logic using the technology of your choice, and we take care
of the rest for you.

[heading :size 2 What are the Kenshi Oracle Network use cases?]

Your only limitation is your imagination! Whether you want to check if your user owns a specific
NFT on another chain, want to check the price of a token or a real-life asset, or check the weather
data or the results of a sports match, all is possible on the Kenshi Oracle Network.

You can find a few blueprints for custom oracles in our
[link /docs/services/oracle-network/custom/blueprints documentation]:

[list
  [:[bold Simple Oracle] shows you how to implement the simplest possible oracle. You can start
  from this blueprint and build something magical.]
  [:[bold Price Oracle] shows you how to implement a price oracle, sourcing the price data
  from CoinGecko.]
  [:[bold Weather Oracle] is a sample weather oracle using the BrightSky APIs.]
  [:[bold Proof of Balance Oracle!] Do you want to check if a user owns a specific asset on another chain?
  This oracle shows you how to do that.]
  [:[bold VRF Oracle] blueprint uses the Kenshi ECVRF libraries to create a standards-compliant
  dedicated VRF oracle.]]

[heading :size 2 How to build an oracle for the Kenshi Oracle Network?]

You need to implement Kenshi's Custom Oracle Protocol using your preferred technologies
and host them on a serverless (or serverful!) platform such as Vercel, Cloudflare Workers,
or AWS Lambda. You can use Python, Go, Node.js, or any other programming language.

The Custom Oracle Protocol is simple; you need a public HTTP[:S:] endpoint that receives
events from the Oracle Network's Event Dispatcher, processes the event, and returns a JSON
response with instructions on what to do with the event. You can read more about it in our
[link https://old.timeleap.swiss/docs/services/oracle-network/custom/protocol documentation].

You also need a smart contract to make this work. You need to emit an event from your contract;
we send this event to your custom oracle for processing. The Oracle Network then needs to call
a method on your smart contract to deliver the results.

Once these are ready, go to the Kenshi Oracle Network [link /dashboard/oracle-network/custom dashboard]
and click on the create button.
Then you input your contract's address and ABI, configure a few parameters, and you're good to go.

Kenshi provides the following services:

[heading :size 2 Is the Oracle Network secure?]

I'm glad you asked! We have already prepared a page about security in our
[link /docs/services/oracle-network/custom/security documentation]. Let's go
through a few of the critical points!

[list
  [: We derive the private key of each oracle from an HDWallet stored in a secure secret manager.
    Private keys and seed phrases are not stored or accessible elsewhere.]
  [: We recommend you supply the oracle with enough gas for only a few requests. When there's a new
    request, Kenshi sends it to your oracle's endpoint for processing; you can check the balance
    of the oracle there and add gas if required.]
  [: We recommend signing your data and verifying it on-chain as instructed in “EIP-712: Typed
     structured data hashing and signing.” This way, you can ensure no validator or attacker
     has manipulated your data in the delivery process.]]

Ultimately, the oracle will be as safe as you, the developer, can make it. You will be safe if you
follow the security recommendations in our
[link /docs/services/oracle-network/custom/security documentation].

[heading :size 2 How much does it cost to run a custom oracle?]

Very little. We charge a fixed $49.95 per month plus $0.0002 per request. We will adjust
the price as we learn more about the oracle needs of our clients!

You can head over to our [link /dashboard/oracle-network/custom dashboard] and create a
custom oracle. Check the [link /docs/services/oracle-network/custom documentation] and
[link /docs/services/oracle-network/custom/blueprints blueprints] to get started quickly.
Happy hacking on the Oracle Network!
