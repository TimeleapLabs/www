title { What problems does Timeleap solve for developers? }

The new Timeleap release today puts us one step closer to the release of our
mainnet. We're not far away from a stable v1.0.0 release. In fact, the current
release will be marked as a v1.0.0 release candidate once we take it through
internal testing and resolve any issues that may arise. Otherwise, the product
is feature complete and ready for use.

While we're preparing for the mainnet release, we'd like to let everyone know
that Timeleap can be used independent of the mainnet, and it solves many
development problems as a standalone product. In this post, we'll go over some
of the problems that Timeleap solves for developers, and review what are the
the technical use cases for Timeleap.

title { IoT and Embedded Systems, size = 2 }

Small devices like IoT sensors and embedded systems are often limited in
computing power and memory. For example, if you're building a smart home system,
you may have a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino device that needs to process sound,
video, or other data. Depending on the type of data and the process you're
running, you may need to offload some of the processing to a more powerful
device.

You can use Timeleap to run code on a more powerful device, and then send the
results back to the small device. This allows you to run more complex algorithms
on the small device without overloading it. For example, you can send image data
from a camera to a more powerful device to detect objects in the image, and then
send the results back to the small device to take action.

Furthermore, Timeleap can be used to send and receive events between devices, or
to trigger actions based on events. For example, you can use Timeleap to send an
event when a sensor detects motion, and then trigger an action on another device
based on that event. You can also notify your devices of an available update,
and then trigger the update process on the devices.

title { Microservices Architecture, size = 2 }

Microservices architecture is a popular way to build scalable and maintainable
applications. In a microservices architecture, you break down your application
into small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network.
Each service is responsible for a specific task, and can be developed, deployed,
and scaled independently, using the programming language and framework that best
suits the task.

Timeleap can act as a message broker between microservices, allowing them to
communicate with each other in a decoupled way. Using Sia schema, you can define
the structure of the data that is sent between services, and then use Timeleap to
send and receive messages or to call specific functions on other services. 

title { API Gateway, size = 2 }

Whether you are making an API Gateway for your own application or selling APIs
to other developers, Timeleap can help you build a scalable and secure API
Gateway. Using Sia schema you can define a common interface for your APIs, and
then you can compile them to client libraries in different programming languages
to make it easier for developers to use your APIs.

Furthermore, Timeleap requires Ed25519 signatures for all transactions, which
means that you can use Timeleap to verify the authenticity of the requests that
are sent to your API Gateway. This helps you prevent unauthorized access to your
APIs, and ensures that the requests are coming from the right sources.

title { Blockchain Technology, size = 2 }

Just like embedded devices, smart contracts on blockchain networks are limited
in computing power and memory. Timeleap can be used to run code on a more
powerful device, and then send the results back to the smart contract. This
allows you to run more complex algorithms on the smart contract without making
it too expensive to run.

Timeleap can help you source events from a blockchain network, and then trigger
actions based on those events. For example, you can use Timeleap to listen for
Transfer events on a smart contract, and then trigger an action when a specific
address sends tokens to another address. You could also transfer messages
cross-chain, for example, from Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain, and use that to
make a cross-chain swap or a bridge.

the next level with Timeleap }

title { Event-Driven Architecture, size = 2 }

Event-driven architecture is yet-another popular way to build scalable and
maintainable applications. An event-driven architecture consists of event
producers and event consumers. Event producers generate events, and event
consumers listen for events and take action based on them. Events can be used to
trigger actions, to notify other services of changes, or to send data between
services.

Timeleap messaging protocol can be used to send and receive events between
services, or to trigger actions based on events. The ability to broadcast events
to multiple consumers, and to filter events based on specific criteria is a
built-in feature of the Timeleap client libraries. This allows you to build
scalable and maintainable applications that can react to changes in real-time.

title { Conclusion }

While we wait for our mainnet release, we encourage developers to try out
Timeleap and see how it can help them solve their development problems. Whether
you're building IoT devices, microservices, API Gateways, or blockchain
applications, Timeleap can help you build scalable and maintainable
applications. We're excited to see what you build with Timeleap, and we're here
to help you along the way.
