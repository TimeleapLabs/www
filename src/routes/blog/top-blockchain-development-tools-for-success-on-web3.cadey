[heading Top 18 Blockchain Development Tools for Success on Web3]

Since the creation of the internet, developers have relied on different tools to build their
applications and websites. Over time, these tools have become more sophisticated and easier to use
and now that we enter the age of Web3, we have an entirely new set of blockchain development tools.

So whether you're a seasoned developer looking to dip your toes in this relatively new territory
or just someone interested in becoming a Web3 and blockchain developer, you need to be familiar
with these tools to start building on the blockchain. That's why we made this handy list just for you!

    Top 18 Blockchain Development Tools for Success on Web3]]

[heading :size 2 Programming Languages]

First things first, you'll need to use some programming language to build your apps as a developer.
Though technically not tools themselves, programming languages will significantly impact which blockchain
development tools you can and should use down the line. So choose carefully.

These are the best languages to learn for developing on a blockchain:

[heading :size 3 1. Solidity]

[link https://docs.soliditylang.org/ Solidity] is the programming language most associated
with the Ethereum blockchain. However, it also works with other EVM blockchains (Ethereum Virtual Machine).
You will use Solidity to create smart contracts and dApps. Smart contracts can facilitate lending,
borrowing, trading, escrow, voting, and many other things. There are many potential use cases, and you
can test them out if you learn how to code in Solidity.

You can learn more about this programming language by reading its documentation.

[alert info
  dApps (or DApps) are decentralized applications that run on the blockchain and usually rely
  on smart contracts and cryptocurrencies.]

[heading :size 3 2. JavaScript]

JavaScript (JS) is a great first language to learn. So you can start here and then move on to Solidity.
Because C++, JavaScript, and Python influence Solidity, you'll have an easier time learning it if you
know any of these programming languages beforehand.

Most of the websites you use daily have some JavaScript code; this means you can also use your knowledge
of this language in front-end development for Web2.

[heading :size 3 3. Python]

Python is another good choice for starting your journey to becoming a blockchain developer. Like
JavaScript, knowing it will help you when you start with Solidity, and it can be used on other
websites, especially by backend programmers.

You can use Python and JavaScript to interact with smart contracts using Web3 libraries, which
is why knowing them will help you as a blockchain and Web3 developer.

[alert info
  For a blockchain developer, knowing Solidity is a must. But proficiency in at least
  one other programming language like Python or JavaScript will make things easier for you.]

[heading :size 2 Frameworks and Libraries (+Test Blockchains)]

Many applications use the same type of layers and modules to perform the same standard functions,
and a long time ago, programmers figured out that they could save a lot of time if they had reusable
code for these functions. So they started building libraries.

There was also the problem of structure. Not everyone knew the best practices for writing clean code,
and this is where frameworks came in to solve the problem. Programming frameworks give you a ready-made,
standardized structure for your application.

With frameworks and libraries, you don't have to reinvent the wheel for every one of your projects.
But even after using them and writing your app, you'll need another environment to test it before the
final deployment. If you're a blockchain developer, this environment would be called a test blockchain
or test node.

Let's see some of the best options when it comes to these blockchain development tools:

[heading :size 3 4. Hardhat / Hardhat Network]

[link https://hardhat.org/ Hardhat] will give you an ideal environment to develop smart contracts
and dApps. It comes with the Hardhat network, which allows you to build on a local Ethereum node on
your local machine. In other words, it is a test blockchain on which you can deploy your smart
contracts, then test and debug them.

You'll be able to use Solidity and JavaScript on Hardhat.

[alert warning Blockchain is forever! Once you deploy your smart contract on an actual blockchain,
you won't be able to edit or change it. You need to test and debug on a test node first.]

[heading :size 3 5. Truffle / Ganache]

Like Hardhat, [link https://trufflesuite.com/ Truffle] will provide you with an environment to build, 
test, debug, and deploy your smart contracts. Truffle uses a test blockchain called Ganache, which
will give you access to a local Ethereum node.

Truffle supports Solidity and JavaScript as well. Hardhat and Truffle are similar. The final
choice between them comes down to your personal preferences.

[heading :size 3 6. Brownie]

[link https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ Brownie] is another framework for developing
smart contracts. It also lets you build for Ethereum
and other EVM blockchains. And it uses Ganache to run a local blockchain for testing purposes.
But the main difference between this framework and the previous ones on our list is that Brownie
is Python-based. So you can use Solidity and Python on it.

[heading :size 2 Oracles]

Blockchains are designed as closed systems with limited connections to the outside world. But what
if your dApps or smart contracts need real-world data to perform a specific task? How can you get
external data into a blockchain? The answer is through the use of an oracle.

Oracles are like bridges that connect your dApp or smart contract to a trusted source of information.
For example, you'll need access to real-time cryptocurrency prices and exchange rates to build a
trading app. And the only way to get this data to your dApp is an oracle.

If you want to get data from online sources, you need to use an oracle. But you can also use hardware
oracles to receive data from information-reading gadgets and IoT devices (Internet of Things).

If you want to use oracles, you need to be familiar with these tools:

[heading :size 3 7. Kenshi Oracles]

Kenshi has built a high-performance asynchronous oracle network for hosting custom oracles. This
network will let you develop your oracles using the tools and technology you already know.
(Read the documentation [link https://old.timeleap.swiss/docs/services/oracle-network here].)

You can also use our [link https://old.timeleap.swiss/docs/services/oracle-network/custom/blueprints blueprints]
as a guide to get started with a price oracle, weather oracle, proof of balance oracle, and more.

Kenshi also offers all the tools you need to build a VRF (verifiable random function) oracle
for your dApp or smart contract. You need randomness in games, lotteries, betting systems,
and more. VRF oracles can provide this randomness safely and securely.

[heading :size 3 8. Chainlink Oracles]

Chainlink offers access to a network of oracles you can use for your apps and smart contracts.
You can utilize one source or multiple sources for the data you need, and Chainlink will use
its process to provide you with the best possible source and answer.

[alert info
  If you don't want to slow down your dApp, you need fast oracles. Kenshi's VRF oracle is
  much faster than Chainlink's. You can read about our comparison between the two
  [link https://blog.kenshi.io/kenshi-vrf-40-to-infinitely-faster-than-chainlink-7856853a3ac1 here].]

[heading :size 2 Nodes]

After you build your app, you'll need access to your chosen blockchain to deploy it. Blockchain is a
closed, peer-to-peer network of nodes. These nodes work together to keep the whole network secure
and reliable. When you want to deploy your app or contract, you need to do it through one of them.

You can use an already running node through a node provider or create and run one yourself,
which can be costly and technically challenging. Either way, you should be familiar with
these blockchain tools:

[heading :size 3 9. Infura]

[link https://www.infura.io/ Infura] started as a node provider (node as a service platform)
for the Ethereum blockchain. But now, it provides access to many layer1 and layer2 blockchains
and also includes other services for developers.

[heading :size 3 10, 11. Alchemy and QuickNode]

[link https://www.alchemy.com/ Alchemy] and [link https://www.quicknode.com/ QuickNode] are
node providers that can give you access to Web3 development tools.

Infura, Alchemy, and QuickNode have similar features when providing access to blockchains.
So the final choice between them comes down to your personal preferences and other features
you look for in a node provider.

[heading :size 3 12. Chainstack]

[link https://chainstack.com/ Chainstack] is another platform that can give you quick and easy
access to a blockchain node. It supports Ethereum and many other layer1 and layer2 blockchain protocols.

Chainstack also provides Web3 development tools and solutions for your projects,
such as multi-cloud, hybrid, and on-premises hosting and globally distributed deployments.

Chainstack is our official partner, and we can tell you first-hand about their fast and reliable
service. Read more about this partnership here.

[heading :size 3 13. GETH]

If you want to help strengthen a decentralized blockchain while being able to deploy your apps
and contracts, you can set up and operate a node yourself. To get started with the Ethereum
blockchain, you should check out the official Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol or 
[link https://geth.ethereum.org/ "Geth."]

[heading :size 2 Data Query]

Blockchains are like massive databases with no native searchability. So finding the information 
you want on them can take time and effort. That's why you'll need a tool to explore the blockchain,
collect the data you wish to, and index it, so you can use simple queries to get the intended
final results for your app or contract.

[heading :size 3 14. Kenshi's Deep Index]

Kenshi offers three services with its deep index tool. You can use "sync" to retrieve, store,
and index data. Then you can query and search the indexed data using MQL or GraphQL to get the
final results for your app. Finally, you can get notifications about new blockchain events
on your HTTP endpoints, which you can do through Reverse-API.

You can learn more about these services by reading the
[link https://old.timeleap.swiss/docs/services/deep-index documentation].

[heading :size 2 Wallets]

You've seen the option to sign-up and log in with google, or some other service, on different
websites. That's Web2. But there is something similar in Web3. On the blockchain, you'll have
one identity: your public address created by your wallet.

So to use any service that interacts with Web3, you will need a wallet. There are many options.
But to make things easier, you should choose a wallet built primarily to interact with Web3
apps and contracts.

[heading :size 3 15. MetaMask]

[link https://metamask.io/ MetaMask] is the wallet of choice for many developers and crypto
holders for a good reason. It is designed for one main application: to connect you to Web3,
powered by Ethereum and other EVM blockchains.

The easiest way to use MetaMask is to install it on your browser as an extension. But remember
that with these kinds of "hot" wallets, you should be extra careful. Otherwise, you can fall
victim to a scam and lose everything in your wallet.

[heading :size 3 16. Brave]

[link https://brave.com/ Brave] is a browser compatible with Web3 out of the box. It has a
built-in wallet that works similarly to MetaMask. You should try this browser; using the
brave wallet will be a natural and easy choice.

[heading :size 2 Other Blockchain Tools]

[heading :size 3 17. Ethereum Unit Converter]

When it comes to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, we have several units of measurement.
A small mistake in converting one to the other when writing a dApp or smart contract can have
catastrophic consequences. So bookmark [link https://eth-converter.com/ this handy tool]
and thank us later.

[heading :size 3 18. Etherscan]

[link https://etherscan.io/ Etherscan] is a blockchain explorer that can give you a lot of
information about the current state of Ethereum, transactions on this blockchain, and more. 

[heading :size 2 Conclusion]

You'll need many tools to start your journey as a newbie blockchain developer. We introduced
some of the essential blockchain development tools here. But there are many more. Send this
article to your fellow programmers and ask them for their recommendations. It's the only way
