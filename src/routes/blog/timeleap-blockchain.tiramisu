title { Timeleap Blockchain }

I'm sure the title of this article has got you curious. A lot has happened since
we announced our plans for the Timeleap AI camera, and you might wonder: how did
we go from a camera to blockchain? I'm excited to share this journey with you.

Let us start with a quick recap of what Timeleap has been up to since then.

title { The AI Camera }

So how goes one from an AI camera to a blockchain? One might think of a camera
as a device that captures images and videos, and one could imagine what AI can
do on a device like this. But how does one actually make a camera like that? It
is not as simple as taking images from the camera and running them through an AI
model.

  alt = How deep goes the rabbit hole?,
  caption = How deep goes the rabbit hole?
}

Not going too deep into the technical details, a camera that processes or
preprocesses images using AI has a complex architecture involving multiple steps
of image acquisition, preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing. Let me give
you an example: 

First, you'd use a vision model to analyze and describe the photo in detail.
Next, this description is passed to a logic model that understands the context
and generates relevant metadata. With the metadata in hand, you can then combine
it with the original image and use a text-and-image-to-image model to create
variations or even generate entirely new images based on the provided context.
I excluded trivial steps such as image enhancement and noise reduction for brevity.

Thanks to the camera, we got the opportunity to work on a complete AI stack, from
simple image upscaling to complex vision and logic models. Once we were there we
took them outside the camera, generalized them, and started talking to others. We
got a lot of people interested, we listened to their feedback, and iterated on our
ideas.

Still, what does that have to do with a blockchain?!

title { The Case of Fren+ }

We made a couple of announcements about link { Fren+, to = https://fren.plus }
earlier; an AI companions app powered by Timeleap tech. The good? They could
quickly prototype their app using our distributed application stack. Our
technology stack is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing developers to
easily integrate various AI capabilities into their applications. It didn't take
long for them to release their MVP using our guidance, and tech.

  alt = "The good, the bad, and the ugly",
  caption = "The good, the bad, and the ugly"
}

The bad? Sourcing reliable GPUs from the cloud was a nightmare. Classic cloud
providers have insane pricing models, and the competition for resources is fierce.
On the other hand, specialized AI cloud providers are not mature enough to meet
the demands of cutting-edge AI applications.

The ugly? We are not providing infrastructure, only software. This means that
while we can help developers build their applications, we can't solve the
underlying infrastructure problems they face.

And the solution? A blockchain. We've been working together with the Fren+ team,
and we are onboarding GPU machines on premises. Early tests are positive, and
our worker-broker model works perfect for this use case. Once we are satisfied
with the results, we are going to scale this solution to all our users who want
to lend their unused GPU resources to the network.

title { TLP token and Testnet Rewards }

TLP will be the native token of the Timeleap blockchain, used both for
governance and as a utility token within the ecosystem. Users will be able to
earn TLP tokens by participating in the network, whether by lending their GPU
resources or by contributing to the development of applications on the platform.

We haven't forgotten about the early supporters of the project. Those who
participated in the initial testing and provided valuable feedback will be
rewarded with TLP tokens as a token of our appreciation.

title { Timeleap as an Incubator }

Timeleap aims to be more than just a blockchain platform; we want to be an
incubator for innovative applications. By providing developers with the tools
and resources they need to build and scale their applications, we hope to foster
a vibrant ecosystem of innovation.

}

Just like we did with Fren+, we will actively seek out and support promising
projects within the Timeleap ecosystem. By providing mentorship, resources, and
access to our technology stack, we hope to empower developers to bring their
innovative ideas to life.

If you have a project in mind that could benefit from our support, we encourage
you to reach out to us. Together, we can build the future of decentralized and
distributed applications. We are not looking for a specific theme yet, all ideas
are welcome. However, in the future, we might focus on specific areas such as AI,
machine learning, and computer vision.

title { Conclusion }

Timeleap is poised to revolutionize the way we think about decentralized
applications and AI. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we can
create a more efficient, transparent, and secure ecosystem for developers and
users alike. We are excited to embark on this journey and look forward to
collaborating with like-minded individuals and organizations.

More details will be shared soon; we will be launching a public and an
enterprise network. Users will be able to join any of the networks under the
Timeleap umbrella and take advantage of the unique features and benefits each
network offers. In the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any
questions or ideas you'd like to discuss.
