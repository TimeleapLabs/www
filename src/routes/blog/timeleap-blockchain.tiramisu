title { Timeleap Blockchain }

What everyone's been waiting for is finally here! We're excited to announce our
plans for the launch of the Timeleap Blockchain, a groundbreaking initiative
that aims to revolutionize the way we interact with decentralized technologies.

Walk with us through this article as we unveil the vision, features, and
benefits of the Timeleap Blockchain.

title { Infrastructure, in Addition to Technology }

For a long time, Timeleap positioned itself as a technology company, focusing on
cutting edge solutions for distributed computing. In the past few months, a
number of projects have emerged that are building on top of Timeleap's
technology, and we're excited to see how these initiatives will contribute to
the growth of the Timeleap ecosystem.

With that being said, we believe that the next step in our journey is to invest
in the infrastructure that will support these projects and enable them to
thrive. The infrastructure landscape as it stands today is fragmented and
lacks the cohesion needed to drive widespread adoption of decentralized
technologies.

With the launch of link { Fren+, to = https://fren.plus }, and the development
of our own Timeleap AI Camera and AI stack, more than ever we are seeing the
need for a unified and robust infrastructure that can support the diverse needs
of our growing ecosystem. The Timeleap Blockchain aims to address these
challenges by providing solid and scalable infrastructure that can support a
wide range of applications and use cases.

title { First Steps Towards Decentralization }

Timeleap is building a permissioned blockchain on top of the Timeleap network
core stack. Each Timeleap team member is receiving a node to run at home,
creating a decentralized network of contributors who lend their computing power
to the network. Combined, the power of these nodes will be put to test in
production by Fren+ a new project launching on the Timeleap network.

Once fully operational and stable, we will open up the network to external
contributors and projects, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized
applications running on contributed infrastructure.

title { What Should You Expect }

We are looking forward to launching two variants of the Timeleap Blockchain: An
enterprise network with those who will form a contract with Timeleap SA, or use
a partner service to join the network. This will be a permissioned blockchain,
providing enhanced security and privacy for enterprise use cases.

The second variant will be a public network, open to anyone who wants to
participate and contribute to the ecosystem. This network will prioritize
decentralization and transparency, allowing developers to build and deploy their
applications without the need for intermediaries.

Those of you interested in participating in the Timeleap Blockchain can look
forward to a range of opportunities, whether you're an enterprise looking to
leverage our permissioned network or just looking to lend your unused computing
resources to the public network.

title { What Will Be There on Day One? }

In addition to the core blockchain infrastructure and Fren+, we will be
launching multiple applications designed to showcase the capabilities of the
Timeleap Blockchain and provide real-world use cases for developers and
enterprises. Thanks to being technology-agnostic there will be bold { 1000+ }
applications that you can immediately run on the Timeleap Blockchain.

We will also release a set of developer tools and resources to help you get
started with building on the Timeleap Blockchain. This will include SDKs, APIs,
a new wallet app, and documentation to streamline the development process and
make it easier for you to create innovative applications.

title { TLP Token }

Once we release the Timeleap Blockchain, we will also introduce the TLP token,
which will play a crucial role in the ecosystem. The TLP token will be used for
various purposes, including transaction fees, staking, and governance.

The conversion rate between KNS, our existing token, and TLP will be 1:1, with
a bidirectional bridge allowing for seamless transfers between the two tokens
between Arbitrum and Timeleap Blockchain.

alert {
  type = info,
  title = Stay Tuned for More Updates,
  
  You do not need to migrate your KNS tokens immediately. We will provide more
  information on the migration process as we get closer to the launch date.
}

Early participants in the Timeleap Network test may be eligible to receive TLP
tokens when the Timeleap Blockchain goes live, in recognition of their
contributions.

title { Conclusion }

The Timeleap Blockchain represents a significant step forward in the evolution
of decentralized technologies. By providing a robust and scalable
infrastructure, we aim to empower developers and enterprises to build innovative
applications that leverage the full potential of blockchain technology.

As we move closer to the launch of the Timeleap Blockchain, we encourage you to
stay engaged and explore the opportunities that lie ahead. Whether you're an
enterprise looking to enhance your operations or a developer eager to create the
next big thing, the Timeleap Blockchain will be your platform of choice.

A public roadmap is coming soon, which we will announce on our link { X, to =
https://x.com/TimeleapLabs } channel.
