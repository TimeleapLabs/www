title { Broker & Subnet Lifecycle }

This page explains how a broker initializes, registers, and maintains a subnet using the provided admin tools.

Subnets are broker-defined. A subnet includes the broker itself, any authorized workers, and their linked plugins. The broker is responsible for enforcing staking, access, and lifecycle rules.

list {
  items = Start the broker with its identity configured in inlineCode { conf.yaml },
  items = Stake KNS using inlineCode { tl-admin stake },
  items = Link stake to the broker's identity with inlineCode { tl-admin link },
  items = Submit subnet metadata with inlineCode { tl-admin update-subnet },
  items = Authorize each worker identity with inlineCode { tl-admin authorize },
  items = Optionally assign user credit with inlineCode { tl-admin credit }
}

Each broker enforces its own policy. Timeleap only provides the toolingâ€”usage is fully up to each subnet.

Subnets can revoke access, rotate identities, and impose slashing or uptime requirements as needed.
