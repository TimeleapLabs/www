title { Plugin System }

Plugins are WebSocket-based services that expose programmable logic to brokers.  
They act as extensions of a worker and are invoked when a client makes a request through the broker.

list {
  items = Defined using inlineCode { .sia } schemas for fast binary serialization,
  items = The worker connects to the plugin over WebSocket at startup,
  items = The plugin is exposed to the broker through the workerâ€™s plugin bridge
}

Plugins do not communicate directly with clients. Instead, the broker relays plugin requests, dispatches them to the appropriate worker, and returns the result to the client.

Plugin interfaces are defined with inlineCode { .sia } and compiled into both plugin and client code for type-safe communication.

Plugins can expose multiple methods and can be long-running services that keep internal state.
