heading { level = 2, Unchained }

Unchained is a federated, decentralized network for data validation. You can
find our Unchained progress here:

list {
  [ ✅ bold { Federated Network }: "The Unchained testnet is available. The
    Unchained client is able to auto-recover and connect to peers."],
  [ ✅ bold { Data Validation }: "The underlying decentralized protocol for
    validating pieces of data is in place. BLS signature aggregation is
    used by peers to sign data."],
  [ ✅ bold { Persistence }: "The validated data is persisted in PostgreSQL."],
  [ ⏳ bold { Smart Contracts }: "Unchained uses a Liquid Proof of Stake consensus
    mechanism. We are working on smart contracts to allow users to stake their
    KNS tokens for the Unchained network."],
  [ ⏳ bold { RPC }: "We need an interface for consumers to be able to query
    validated data on the Unchained network."],
  [ 🗓 bold { Plugins }: "Plugins for the different Unchained use cases still
    need to be developed."],
  [ 🗓 bold { Documentation }: "Unchained isn't fully documented yet."],
  [ 🗓 bold { Explorer }: "We need an explorer and status page for Unchained."]

heading { level = 3, HSM }

list { 
  [ "HSMs can be used to manage custody of crypto assets. For example,
    by banks or exchanges." ],
  [ "They can be used as programmable wallets by DeFi projects, or to
    make secure API requests." ],
  [ "The Kenshi HSM can be used as a more secure alternative to existing
    secret managers, such as HashiCorp Vault." ],
  [ "These devices can also be used for decentralized oracles, data
    collection networks, supply chain management, and plenty of other use
    cases." ]
}

You can find our HSM progress here:

list {
  [ ✅ bold { Prototype }: "We have made a prototype HSM, including the hardware,
    and several firmwares."],
  [ ⏳ bold { Open Hardware }: "We are investigating a Bring-Your-Own-Hardware
    option where users can benefit from the Kenshi HSM capabilities on hardware
    that is easily sourceable on the market."],
  [ ⏳ bold { Partnerships }: "We are in contact with Swiss semiconductor and
    secure hardware manufacturers."],
  [ 🗓 bold { Firmwares }: "Firmwares for different use cases, and a GUI app for
    managing the software on the HSM devices are required before HSM release."],
  [ 🗓 bold { Certification }: "The custom-made electronics need to be certified."]
