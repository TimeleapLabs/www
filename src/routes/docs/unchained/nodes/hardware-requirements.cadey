[heading :size 1 Hardware Requirements]

Hardware requirements vastly differ depending on the selected features,
datasets, client roles, or the client libraries used. Technically speaking, any
device capable of signing a BLS12-381 message is capable of being an Unchained
node. See for example, [link https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9895015
"BLS12-381 Pairing Implementation with RAM Footprint Smaller than 4KB"].

To run the Unchained Go client in different modes, you'll need the following
hardware specs:

                              [: N/A]
                              [: N/A]                                            ]

                              [: 100Mbps symmetric] 
                              [: 100Mbps symmetric]
                              [: 100Mbps symmetric]                              ]
]

Please note that the above values are the [italic minimum] recommended levels.
As the network grows, the requirements for running nodes will change as well.
