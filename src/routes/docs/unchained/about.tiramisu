heading {level =  1 About}

Unchained is a decentralized, federated network for data validation. Unchained
nodes work to validate data together and are rewarded in KNS tokens. It is also
possible to run Unchained as a private or local network, or independently as a
part of a bigger application.

heading {level =  2 Purpose}

Unchained has the capability to index data from any blockchain, act as a message
broker between different blockchains, and supply verified data to smart
contracts and oracles. However, its primary purpose goes beyond just serving as
a connector between on-chain and off-chain environments, or providing data to
existing blockchains.

Unchained is a standalone platform suitable for various applications that need
validated and verified data. This data remains valuable even without being sent
to the blockchain. Unchained enables direct use of verified data by analytical
tools, data explorers, for training AI models, or any other use case requiring
trusted data.

Moreover, the Unchained network offers not just raw data, but also the necessary
tools for data processing and analysis. It can be used as a grid computing
platform where users lend their computation power to the consumers, or as an
edge computing platform where users are re-routed to the nearest available node.

To achieve its objectives, Unchained is not required to function as a blockchain
in the traditional sense, where data is organized chronologically, compiled into
blocks, and linked sequentially to the preceding ones. Unchained allows its
nodes the flexibility to validate and verify data at their own pace. Unlike
traditional blockchain models where there's competition to propose a block, in
Unchained, each piece of data validated by a peer is acknowledged and recorded
by other peers as additional verification.

Nodes within Unchained are not obligated to focus on identical data sets. Each
peer has the autonomy to choose which data to validate and store, and which to
bypass for any given reason. This approach grants Unchained exceptional
flexibility and scalability, as data is effectively sharded and made available
on a demand-driven basis.

heading {level =  3 Federated}

The consensus mechanism in Unchained is multifaceted. The first aspect concerns
how peers communicate and acknowledge data within the network. The networking
model in Unchained is federated. Nodes in this federated network can assume
different roles; workers, for example, have the task of sourcing, validating,
and processing data, while brokers are tasked with re-routing messages and
supervising the workers.

The federated network and the separation in functionality allows
resource-constraint devices to join the Unchained network and benefit from its
features as well. As an example, a small IoT sensor can send validated sensor
data to Unchained without the need of running a "full" node, or a small device
can call a computationally heavy algorithm on the Unchained grid and harness its
computation power.

heading {level =  2 Liquid Proof of Stake}

In situations where nodes present different values for a specific data metric
(M), or the result of a process, the resolution hinges on the voting power of
each validator. This is where
link {https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/liquid-proof-of-stake/#delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos,
Liquid Proof of Stake (LPoS)} comes into play.
  
The voting power of each node is determined by the amount of KNS tokens they
have staked, plus any staked Katana NFTs, and any KNS tokens or Katana NFTs
delegated to them by the other users.

Consumers or peers assessing the validity of data must consider the aggregated
voting powers backing the different reported values for each dataset or
computation. A threshold is set by the consumers (e.g., +51% or +90%), above
which data is deemed valid. This mechanism ensures that the majority decision,
weighted by stake, dictates the accepted truth within the network.

The LPoS system offers several advantages. It aligns validators' incentives with
the network's health and integrity, as their influence depends on their stake.
This reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior, as acting against the
network's interests would directly impact a validator's own stake.

Additionally, LPoS enables more dynamic participation and decentralization, as
stakeholders can delegate their tokens, thus contributing to the network's
governance without being active validators themselves. This method also allows
for more flexibility and diversity in network decision-making, as it
incorporates the perspectives of a broader range of participants.

heading {level =  3 Data Validation}

Unchained implements the BLS12-381 algorithm combined with proof of Knowledge of
Secret Key (KOSK) and signature aggregation. The BLS12-381 algorithm is a
cryptographic pairing function that enables efficient and secure elliptic curve
operations. This algorithm is particularly known for its strength and efficiency
in smaller-sized keys compared to other cryptographic algorithms.

Proof of Knowledge of Secret Key (KOSK) is a critical component in this setup.
It ensures that only the holder of the private key can produce a valid
signature, preventing Rogue Public Key attacks on aggregated signatures. The
signature itself cannot be used to derive the private key, adding an extra layer
of protection.

Signature aggregation allows multiple signatures to be combined into a single,
compact signature. The benefits of signature aggregation are significant,
especially in terms of scalability and efficiency. It reduces the amount of data
that needs to be transmitted and stored, which is particularly advantageous in a
system where numerous transactions or validations occur. This not only saves
space but also reduces processing time, making the system efficient and fast.

heading {level =  3 LPoS and Consumers}

For Liquid Proof of Stake (LPoS) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) requests,
Unchained adopts the SECP256K1 cryptographic algorithm, the same as used by
Ethereum. This choice is primarily to maintain compatibility with Ethereum,
facilitating interactions and integrations between Unchained and Ethereum-based
systems.

SECP256K1 is an elliptic curve algorithm widely used in blockchain technologies,
particularly known for its application in Ethereum's transaction signing
process. By using this algorithm, Unchained ensures that its platform can
seamlessly interact with Ethereum's network and services. This compatibility is
crucial for users and applications that operate across both Unchained and
Ethereum platforms, as it simplifies processes and enhances user experience by
allowing the use of the same cryptographic standards and tools.
