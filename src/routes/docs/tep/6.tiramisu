title { Abstract, size = 2 }

This proposal defines the gas, fee, and accounting mechanisms for the Timeleap
Network. It introduces a standardized method for measuring computational work
(gas), defines how the KNS utility token is used across the protocol, and
establishes fee structures for subnetworks that use alternative tokens.

TEP-6 also specifies the responsibilities and functionality of the Accounting
Subnet, a protocol-level component used to track user balances, top-ups, and
execution-linked billing. Together, these mechanisms ensure transparent,
extensible, and regulation-compliant economic operations across all subnets,
while preserving flexibility and incentivizing native token alignment.


title { Motivation, size = 2 }

As the Timeleap Network grows to support varied computation models and
independent subnetworks, it requires a unified and enforceable economic system
that ensures fair contribution, transparent billing, and regulatory compliance.

Without standardized gas metrics, billing could become unpredictable and prone
to abuse. Without consistent fee logic, subnet incentives may drift from network
interests. And without a shared accounting layer, usage tracking and dispute
resolution would be fragmented and unverifiable.

TEP-6 addresses these concerns by:

list {
  items = [
    Introducing a consistent gas model for measuring resource consumption
    across different types of compute workloads.
  ],
  items = [
    Formalizing the role of the KNS token as a protocol-level utility asset,
    while allowing flexible monetization strategies at the subnet level.
  ],
  items = [
    Defining licensing fees and surcharges based on subnet alignment with
    native economic primitives, as introduced in TEP-5.
  ],
  items = [
    Establishing the Accounting Subnet to ensure transparent, verifiable,
    and dispute-resilient usage metering.
  ]
}

This design protects users, incentivizes KNS adoption, supports developer
flexibility, and aligns with FINMA guidelines for utility tokens.


title { Specification, size = 2 }

This section defines the technical and economic specifications for the fee
mechanism introduced in this proposal. It includes the definition of gas as a
unit of computation, the role of the KNS utility token in protocol-level access
and fee alignment, the licensing and surcharge structure for subnet monetization,
and the design of the Accounting Subnet used to track balances, usage, and
billing integrity across the network.

title { Gas Definition, size = 3 }

Gas is the unit of measurement for computational work performed on the Timeleap
Network. It quantifies the amount of resources such as CPU time, memory usage,
network bandwidth, or storage access consumed by a given function or transaction
executed within a subnet.

Each operation on the network incurs a gas cost based on its complexity. This
cost is used to calculate the total fee paid by the user. Fees are charged
upfront from user-held balances managed by a dedicated accounting subnet that
tracks top-ups and consumption. All gas usage is cryptographically linked to
signed user requests and verifiable execution outputs.

While the method for calculating gas may vary between subnets depending on the
services or plugins they host (for example, LLM inference, file transformation,
or custom code execution), the underlying accounting model is standardized
across the network. This enables unified billing, auditing, and enforcement of
economic rules defined in TEP-5 and TEP-6.

title { Gas Token, size = 3 }

KNS is the native utility token of the Timeleap Network and the foundational
access mechanism to protocol-level functionality. It is required for subnet
onboarding, governance participation, staking, and interaction with the core
Timeleap infrastructure such as routing, telemetry, and billing. In compliance
with FINMA definition of a utility token, KNS provides access rights and
governance functionality but does not offer passive income, returns, or
investment gains.

All subnets are required to stake KNS to gain entry to the network and are
subject to slashing in cases of misconduct or rule violations. The staking model
is designed to enforce accountability, align incentives, and support the
integrity of the ecosystem.

While KNS is required for access to Timeleap infrastructure, subnets are not
strictly required to accept KNS as the user-facing gas token for computational
services. Each subnet may define its own monetization model and accept payment
in alternative tokens or currencies. However, to ensure fair contribution to the
ecosystem, subnets must still remit the bold { baseline 3% licensing fee }
defined in TEP-5, and may incur bold { additional surcharges } depending on the
level of alignment with the KNS token:

list {
  items = [
    Subnets accepting bold { KNS only }: bold { 0% additional fee }
  ],
  items = [
    Subnets accepting bold { low-risk assets } (ETH, BTC, USDT, USDC, fiat):
    bold { +3% additional fee }
  ],
  items = [
    Subnets accepting bold { high-risk or unverified assets }:
    bold { +7% additional fee }, unless negotiated
  ]
}

This model balances flexibility and compliance: it allows subnet operators to
design their own economic models while encouraging use of the KNS token to
maintain systemic cohesion. All fees are paid to the Timeleap Network treasury
and are used to fund continued protocol development, operational security, and
infrastructure maintenance.

This structure supports Timeleap's long-term sustainability and ecosystem health
while ensuring KNS remains a core utility token under Swiss regulatory guidance.

title { Accounting Subnet, size = 3 }

The Accounting Subnet is a protocol-level service that tracks user balances,
top-ups, and usage across all computational subnets. It provides standardized
functions for crediting and debiting user accounts, ensuring consistent and
verifiable billing behavior.

All subnets are responsible for accepting and managing top-ups from users in
accordance with the legal and regulatory frameworks applicable in their
jurisdiction. The Accounting Subnet does not handle fiat payments or enforce
regional compliance; rather, it acts as a transparent and auditable ledger of
usage and balance.

Two primary functions are provided:

list {
  items = [
    bold { credit }: accepts user address, token or currency type,
    amount, and other parameters (TBD). Used by subnets to register
    incoming top-ups.
  ],
  items = [
    bold { debit }: accepts user address, task, fee amount, currency,
    and a signed payload. Fails if the signature is invalid, the fee charged
    exceeds the user's maximum allowed fee, or the user does not have enough
    balance.
  ],
  items = [
    bold { rollback }: accepts user address, task, fee amount, currency,
    and a signed payload. Used to reverse a debit operation in case of
    miscalculation or error. Requires a valid signature and sufficient
    balance.
  ]
}

Additional functions such as withdraw, refund, or transfer may be introduced in
future TEPs.

Subnets may choose not to use the Accounting Subnet or to operate a hybrid model
that combines their own ledger with the Accounting Subnet. In either case, they
are required to submit a monthly accounting report to Timeleap in the format
defined by the protocol (to be published separately). Failure to submit timely
or accurate records may result in penalties, including fines, suspension from
plugin access, or temporary delisting.

All accounting records must be timestamped and signed to ensure auditability.
User dispute resolution mechanisms must be available to investigate billing
discrepancies. In case of verified abuse or misreporting, subnet stakes may be
slashed under the governance policies defined in TEP-5.

The Accounting Subnet is modular and upgradeable, with future enhancements
governed via new TEPs to ensure ecosystem-wide alignment.


title { Rationale, size = 2 }

The Timeleap Network's architecture encourages subnet autonomy, plugin
diversity, and decentralized service provisioning. However, this freedom must be
balanced with protocol-wide consistency and accountability.

By separating fee enforcement from token enforcement, this TEP allows subnets to
serve users in any currency while still contributing fairly to the Timeleap
ecosystem. The surcharge model ensures that native token usage is incentivized
but not enforced, preserving both regulatory clarity and developer freedom.

The Accounting Subnet serves as a critical protocol primitive: it enables
subnets to enforce task-level billing, while enabling Timeleap to track
aggregate usage, audit compliance, and resolve disputes. It also creates a
foundation for future ecosystem services such as user dashboards, usage-based
subscriptions, or token-based access tiers.

This design embraces diversity in execution models, while maintaining economic
alignment and legal defensibility across the network.


title { Backwards Compatibility, size = 2 }

This TEP is backwards compatible with the existing Timeleap Network as it only
affects how the network is managed and governed. All existing features and
functionalities of the Timeleap Network will remain the same.
