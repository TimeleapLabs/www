title { Abstract, size = 2 }

Timeleap is a federated network where each node serves a distinct roleâ€”a
fundamental aspect of its technical design. TEP-4 proposes extending this
federation model beyond infrastructure to cover governance, management, and
consensus of the system.

Rather than relying on a global consensus, we aim to introduce subnetworks
(subnets), each operating independently while remaining interconnected through a
federated governance protocol. This governance framework will unify all subnets
under the TLP/KNS token.

title { Motivation, size = 2 }

Timeleap is a distributed network designed specifically for distributed
computation. Timeleap is designed to be fast; to make distributed computation
feasible, it must be able to process a large number of transactions per second.
Adding a global consensus model while keeping the network scalable is a
challenge for the following reasons:

list {
  ordered = Yes,
  items = [
    bold { Scalability }: A robust global consensus adds delays to the
    processing of transactions. While a few milliseconds of delay won't matter
    for most networks, it can be a significant bottleneck for distributed
    computation. This delay becomes more pronounced as the network grows.
  ],
  items = [
    bold { Double Spending or Double Processing }: A loose, asynchronous
    consensus model can lead to double spending or double processing of
    transactions. While the trade-off is acceptable for the primary use case of
    Timeleap, this solution leads to inefficiencies as with this model
    transactions can be processed before making sure a user has enough funds to
    cover them.
  ]
}

The challenges mentioned above occur when using an internal, global consensus
model. To overcome them, we propose a subnet model where consensus is
externalized and can be customized to the specific needs of each subnet. This
approach not only resolves these issues but also brings the following benefits:

list {
  ordered = Yes,
  items = [
    bold { Customization }: Each subnet can have its own consensus model,
    governance, and management. This allows for a more flexible and scalable
    network. Furthermore, the governance token, gas-fee model, and other
    factors can be customized to meet the specific needs of each subnet.
  ],
  items = [
    bold { Scalability }: By externalizing consensus, we can scale the network
    horizontally by adding more subnets. This approach allows for a more
    efficient network that can process a large number of transactions per
    second.
  ],
  items = [
    bold { Data Privacy & Security }: Subnets can be used to isolate data and
    computation, providing a more secure and private environment for users
    while still being interconnected with other subnets.
  ],
  items = [
    bold { Laws & Regulations }: Subnets allow compliance with local laws and
    regulations, which is essential for a global network like Timeleap, where
    legal requirements vary by region. In areas or use cases where these
    regulations are not a concern, public networks can be utilized to offer a
    more open and transparent environment.
  ],
  items = [
    bold { Alliance }: Smaller cloud providers, data centers, and other
    organizations can create their own subnets and join the Timeleap Network.
    This allows them to benefit from the network's security, scalability, and
    other features while maintaining their own governance and management.

    Offering a unified network with a federated governance model allows for
    collaboration between different organizations, creating a robust and
    decentralized network that can compete with bigger, centralized cloud
    providers.
  ],
  items = [
    bold { Flexibility }: Subnets can be created and removed at any time. This
    allows for a more dynamic network where subnets can be added or removed
    based on demand. This also allows for a more competitive environment where
    subnets can compete with each other to offer the best services to users.
  ],
  items = [
    bold { No Lock-Ins }: If a users isn't satisfied with a subnet, they can
    easily switch to another subnet without losing their data or having to go
    through a complex migration process. Users can also use multiple subnets at
    the same time to take advantage of different features offered by each
    subnet. Furthermore, users can opt to run their own subnet if they prefer to
    have full control over their data and computation, while still being
    interconnected with other subnets.

title { Specification, size = 2 }

There Timeleap Network (Subnets) is a network of interconnected subnets, each
operating independently with its own governance, management, and consensus
model. Subnets are interconnected through a federated governance protocol that
unifies all subnets under the TLP/KNS token. The following components are
required to implement the Timeleap Network (Subnets):

title { Network Fees (Gas), size = 3 }

With subnets, each subnet directly receives its own gas fee for processing
transactions. Subnets are responsible themselves for setting the gas fee and
distributing rewards to their validators. The Timeleap Network license requires
that all subnets use the TLP/KNS token as the gas fee.

Exceptions can be made under the BUSL license to allow subnets to use their own
token, or non-crypto currencies as gas fees. In such cases, a portion of the gas
fee must be converted to TLP/KNS and distributed to Timeleap to support the
development of the network. The details of this conversion and distribution are
out of the scope of this TEP and will be covered in a separate document.

title { Governance, size = 3 }

All subnets are required to stake TLP/KNS tokens to participate in the Timeleap
Network. The amount of TLP/KNS required to stake will be covered in a separate
document. Staking should be done through a Timeleap certified smart contract
that keeps track of each subnet. Slashing mechanism will be present on the
governance contract to penalize subnets that misbehave.

Consensus is optimistic in this case. Subnets are responsible for their own
internal consensus model. However, the externalized optimistic governance model
specified in this document applies to all subnets, italic { except those except
by a custom BUSL license }, for example, private networks where a different
licensing model is used.

Users can vote against subnets that misbehave, and the governance contract will
slash the subnet's stake if the vote passes. Each negative vote affects the
reputation of the subnetwork. Network reputation is gained based on tokens
staked, and the time the subnet has been active.

A vote against a subnetwork passes on either of the following conditions:

list {
  ordered = Yes,
  items = [
    bold { 51% of the total staked TLP/KNS votes in favor of slashing the subnet
    stake. In this case, the subnet is partially slashed and their reputation is
    reduced. },
  ],
  items = [
    bold { The reputation of the subnet drops below a certain threshold. In
    which case, the subnet is fully slashed and removed from the network. },
  ],
  items = [
    bold { The user provides undeniable proof of misbehavior. In this case, the
    subnet is partially slashed and their reputation is reduced. },
  ]
}

title { Subnetwork Discovery, size = 3 }

Subnets can be discovered through the Timeleap Subnet Discovery Network (TSDN).
TSDN is a decentralized network that keeps track of all subnets and their
metadata. TSDN itself is a Timeleap Subnet. Subnets can announce themselves to
TSDN and provide metadata such as the subnet's name, description, functionality,
etc... using a TEP-3 broadcast message.

A searchable directory of subnets will be available on the Timeleap website.
Subnets can be discovered by searching for keywords, categories, or by browsing
the directory. The directory will also show the reputation of each subnet based
on the number of tokens staked and the time the subnet has been active.

title { Rationale, size = 2 }

The Timeleap Network is designed to support distributed computation at scale.
However, achieving scalability while maintaining a global consensus introduces
significant challenges. A tightly coupled global consensus mechanism increases
network latency, making high-throughput transaction processing inefficient.
Subnetworks (subnets) address this issue by externalizing consensus, allowing
each subnet to operate independently while remaining interconnected through a
federated governance protocol.

By adopting this model, Timeleap enables a more flexible and scalable
architecture. Each subnet can define its own consensus mechanism, governance
structure, and fee model while adhering to the broader network principles
enforced through TLP/KNS staking. This approach ensures that computation remains
efficient without compromising security or decentralization.

Subnets also offer additional benefits, including regulatory flexibility,
improved data privacy, and a more competitive environment where subnets can
differentiate based on performance, cost, or feature set. Furthermore, by
enabling independent subnet creation, Timeleap promotes a decentralized
ecosystem where smaller cloud providers, data centers, and organizations can
join the network while maintaining control over their infrastructure.

title { Backwards Compatibility, size = 2 }

This TEP is backwards compatible with the existing Timeleap Network as it only
affects how the network is managed and governed. All existing features and
functionalities of the Timeleap Network will remain the same.
