title { Abstract, size = 2 }

This document describes the Timeleap Messaging Protocol (TMP), a protocol for
sharing data and state between nodes on the Timeleap network. TMP enables nodes
to subscribe to topics and receive messages from other nodes, allowing them to
share data and state with each other.

title { Motivation, size = 2 }

Timeleap is a federated network where each node has a specific role. Instead of
using peer-to-peer messaging, Timeleap employs a broker system to route
messages between nodes. This means that, rather than having each node forward
messages for all other nodes, the broker takes on this responsibility.

While this feature enhances network scalability, it introduces a new challenge:
nodes on the network lack access to all data, making state sharing cumbersome.
To address this, we propose the Timeleap Messaging Protocol (TMP) to enable
nodes to efficiently share data and state with each other.

title { Specification, size = 2 }

This section provides a detailed specification of the Timeleap Messaging
Protocol (TMP), outlining its high-level design and user story.

title { Broker-based, size = 3 }

Since the broker is responsible for routing messages between nodes, and is the
connection point for all nodes, it is the ideal place to implement the TMP. The
broker can act as a message hub, allowing nodes to share data and state with
each other.

In case of multiple brokers, they each can subscribe to the same topic and
forward messages to each other. This way, the network can be scaled horizontally
by adding more brokers.

title { Topics, size = 3 }

Topics are the primary way to categorize messages in TMP. Each message is
published to a specific topic, and nodes can subscribe to topics to receive
messages. Topics can be used to share data, state, or events between nodes.

Topics are scoped and workers can use wildcards to subscribe to multiple topics
at once. For example, a worker can subscribe to `system.user.*` to receive messages
related to all users or `system.*` to receive all system messages.

Plugins can define their own topics to share data and state with other nodes.
For example, a chat plugin by developer 'alice' can define topics such as
'tld.alice.chat.message', 'tld.alice.chat.user', and 'tld.alice.chat.room' to
share messages, users, and rooms.

title { Dataframes, size = 3 }

Dataframes are the primary data structure used in TMP to share data and state
between nodes. A dataframe has the following structure:

code {
  language = "go",
  content = """
  type Dataframe struct {
    Hash        []byte
    Timestamp   uint64
    Topic       string
    Meta        []byte
  }
  """
}

The 'Hash' field is a unique identifier for the dataframe, generated by the
publisher. The 'Timestamp' field is the time the dataframe was created. The
'Topic' field is the topic the dataframe belongs to. The 'Meta' field stores
additional metadata about the dataframe in Sia format.

Developers should use the 'Topic' field to determine the type of data in the
dataframe. For example, a dataframe with the topic 'tld.alice.chat.message'
contains a chat message, and the 'Meta' field contains the message content.

title { Rationale, size = 2 }

TMP is designed to enable nodes to share data and state with each other in a
scalable and efficient manner. By using brokers as message hubs, TMP allows
nodes to subscribe to topics and receive messages from other nodes. This
enables nodes to share data and state with each other, making it easier to
build distributed applications on the Timeleap network.

This is an essential requirement to build a decentralized consenus for the
Timeleap network. For example, for every RPC call from a client, the broker can
publish information about the call to all nodes, where each node updates the
balances of the sender and receiver. Since each message contains the signature
of the sender, nodes can verify the authenticity of the message and update the
balances accordingly.

title { Backwards Compatibility, size = 2 }

The Timeleap Messaging Protocol (TMP) has been implemented in the Timeleap
network. This document serves as the formal specification to ensure
compatibility across all nodes. The already implemented TMP will be updated to
comply with this specification.
