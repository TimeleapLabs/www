heading { level = 2, Arduino boards }

Kenshi provides a simple IoT SDK example for controlling LEDs using blockchain events on Arduino boards. You can find the sketch and the smart contracts link { https://github.com/TimeleapLabs/iot-sdk/tree/master/arduino/examples/blinky, here. }

heading { level = 2, ESP32 boards }

Kenshi provides a simple IoT SDK example for controlling LEDs using blockchain events on ESP32 boards. You can find the sketch and the smart contracts link { https://github.com/TimeleapLabs/iot-sdk/tree/master/arduino/examples/blinky32, here. }

heading { level = 2, Zephyr RTOS }

Kenshi provides a simple IoT SDK sample app for the Zephyr RTOS. The sample app receives a blockchain event and prints the results to the console. You can find the sketch and the smart contracts link { https://github.com/TimeleapLabs/iot-sdk/tree/master/arduino/examples/blinky32, here. }

This app is only tested on ESP32 DevkitC! You might need to make a few modifications for it to work on your board.
