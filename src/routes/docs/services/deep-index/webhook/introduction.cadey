[heading Introduction to R-API]

Instead of querying the blockchain or the Timeleap GraphQL endpoint, you can get the
events delivered to your application instead. This allows creating a completely serverless
flow of receiving and processing the blockchain data.

The Timeleap Reverse-API service allows you to input a contract address, contract ABI, a starting block
and an API endpoint (your HTTPS endpoint, AWS Lambda function...). Every time an event is emitted by
your contract address the Reverse-API service sends it to your endpoint.

To use this service head to the Timeleap [link https://timeleap.swiss/dashboard dashboard], connect
your wallet and register an endpoint using the new Reverse-API form. Continue reading on to
get help with the dashboard or see examples of the Reverse-API service.
